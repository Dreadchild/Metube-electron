### What's new ?
We are creating a simple  YouTube video player. The main purpose is a music player, but YouTube is video-based, so you can use it as a video player or you can watch all videos without advertising. Please see below for details.

### Reference
New version releases are always deployed in the repository.
git Subscribe to the top "watch release" to keep the latest version at all times.

### Mac Support?
Can not build because there is no Mac related device. If you purchase a machine, we will support it together.

Hi guys.

I really like the YouTube platform, where you can watch a variety of music.
In fact, this application started to develop because I was inconvenient to use Youtube in my work while I was working.
So I wanted to develop it as a desktop application rather than a web application, and there was a bit more variety in my desire.
I wanted to make features that Youtube does not offer, and I wanted to make it more diverse.
So "MeTube" was born. I'm a web application programmer, but not a designer.
Therefore, I tend to worry about UI / UX and design.

There are a lot of functions that I am planning.
But we need more ideas.
I want to open the source, communicate with various people, develop and complete the app.
But "MeTube" is not known to many people yet.

As an open source music program, I would like to make it together if it is well known.
I do not use English very well, so communication may be somewhat lacking.
But I think that part can be resolved somehow.
If only they have faith and will!

We can not collect all the opinions, but we are seriously reviewing them.
Please give us your feedback if you have any comments.

Thank you. <br>
