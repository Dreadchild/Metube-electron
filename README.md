### What's new ?
We are creating a simple and simple YouTube video player. The main purpose is a music player, but YouTube is video-based, so you can use it as a video player or you can watch all videos without advertising. It is currently in beta, so functionality may be limited. Please see below for details.

### Reference
This app is currently in beta. 
The beta version does not support automatic updates. 
New versions are deployed in the repository. 
there may be bugs and please register issues.
Thank you

### Mac Support?
Can not build because there is no Mac related device. If you purchase a machine, we will support it together.
