### Quota issues
Google does not provide nearly 10,000 quota. This is a very small number that can be used during the development phase. According to the documentation, API keys have been assigned a quota of 10000 from April 2016. You are currently applying for quota and it is unclear whether you are authorized.

<strong>So if you have a Metube user with a high Quota YouTube API key, please me share it.</strong> There is nothing I can do. I would like to continue this project. If possible, minimize your searches and create your own collections to use as collections. The search API consumes a large amount of quota.

### Project Information
This project is a personal project developed with the excellent Electron and Vue.JS.
We are creating a simple  YouTube video player. The main purpose is a music player, but YouTube is video-based, so you can use it as a video player or you can watch all videos without advertising. Please see below for details.

### Reference
New version releases are always deployed in the repository. The new version update is fast
To keep up to date, always subscribe to the parent "watch release".
If you like the program, please click on the star! It will help developers a lot.

### Feature
"Metube" is simple and very fast. While basic search lookup is network dependent, collection management is very fast because it uses IndexedDB

### Roadmap
1. Multiple selection when adding video
2. Copy and move videos added to my collection
3. PouchDB Backup and Restore
4. Background Auto Update
