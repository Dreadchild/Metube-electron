### Issue alternative
the application is implemented so that the application of KEY authentication can be applied by changing the key from the outside. I use the app all day except for sleeping time. As a result, you are always monitoring, so if the quota is exceeded, you can temporarily resolve this problem by changing the KEY from the outside.

### Project Information
This project is a personal project developed with the excellent Electron and Vue.JS.
We are creating a simple  YouTube video player. The main purpose is a music player, but YouTube is video-based, so you can use it as a video player or you can watch all videos without advertising. Please see below for details.

### Reference
New version releases are always deployed in the repository. The new version update is fast
To keep up to date, always subscribe to the parent "watch release".

### Feature
"Metube" is simple and very fast. While basic search lookup is network dependent, collection management is very fast because it uses IndexedDB

### Roadmap
1. Multiple selection when adding video
2. Copy and move videos added to my collection
3. PouchDB Backup and Restore
4. Background Auto Update
