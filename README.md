### Project Information
This project is a personal project developed with the excellent Electron and Vue.JS.

### What's new ?
We are creating a simple  YouTube video player. The main purpose is a music player, but YouTube is video-based, so you can use it as a video player or you can watch all videos without advertising. Please see below for details.

### Reference

To keep up to date, always subscribe to the parent "watch release".
