### What's new ?
I am using vue to improve the performance and problems of existing SharePod (v1). We have resolved and redesigned many of the problems we encountered in developing v1. The v2(MeTube) version will show you how it evolved as a music player. Thank you.

### Do you want to open source?
As a music player, we will provide it as open source if it is developed and stabilized to a certain extent.

### Reference
This app is currently in beta. 
The beta version does not support automatic updates. 
New versions are deployed in the repository. 
Thank you
