### Project Information
This project is a personal project developed with the excellent Electron and Vue.JS.

### What's new ?
We are creating a simple  YouTube video player. The main purpose is a music player, but YouTube is video-based, so you can use it as a video player or you can watch all videos without advertising. Please see below for details.

### Reference
New version releases are always deployed in the repository. The new version update is fast
To keep up to date, always subscribe to the parent "watch release".
If you like the program, please click on the star! It will help developers a lot.

### Feature
"Metube" is simple and very fast. While basic search lookup is network dependent, collection management is very fast because it uses IndexedDB

### Review
Six months have passed since the project started.
In the meantime, I am studying and learning a lot.
I like music and I like YouTube.
We are still very scarce, but we are always trying to provide better quality and better service. I use apps 24 hours a day, bugs, improvements, and new developments, but it's not easy to do it all by yourself. Therefore, your feedback and feedback are always welcome.

### Roadmap

1. recommand music
Notice the changes to the next build in advance.
I was constantly monitoring for suggested music that I showed as a slide at the top of the search page. However, I believe that this function is not a function that will be greatly helpful, and I intend to improve the function for other purposes. Currently, the new method is to display music recently played by other users. It does not indicate who listened to what music. It is intended to naturally share music that other users  heard with other users.

2. Survey by region
Metube has a separate player server.
There is a player server in Asia. As a result, all users are connected to the Asian server.
Metube is developing as a global service, but I do not know much about the rest of Asia. Therefore, many users are currently accessing "Poland" and "Colombia". You need feedback on the ping issue when using the application in your country. If there is a problem with network pinging, I am considering adding a server.
