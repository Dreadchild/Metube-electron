### What's new ?
We are creating a simple  YouTube video player. The main purpose is a music player, but YouTube is video-based, so you can use it as a video player or you can watch all videos without advertising. Please see below for details.

### Reference
New version releases are always deployed in the repository.
git Subscribe to the top "watch release" to keep the latest version at all times.

### Mac Support?
Can not build because there is no Mac related device. If you purchase a machine, we will support it together.
