# Information
Hi.
I think some of you have been having problems with apps lately.
This issue is caused by exceeding the Youtube API daily quota.
Google does not provide 100.00 per day quota, so I think it is a big issue. In addition, Google does not seem to maintain APIs either. We are currently preparing an alternative. If possible, please use the collection. Thank you.

### Project Information
This project is a personal project developed with the excellent Electron and Vue.JS.
We are creating a simple  YouTube video player. The main purpose is a music player, but YouTube is video-based, so you can use it as a video player or you can watch all videos without advertising. Please see below for details.

### Reference
New version releases are always deployed in the repository. The new version update is fast
To keep up to date, always subscribe to the parent "watch release".
If you like the program, please click on the star! It will help developers a lot.

### Feature
"Metube" is simple and very fast. While basic search lookup is network dependent, collection management is very fast because it uses IndexedDB

### Roadmap
1. Multiple selection when adding video
2. Copy and move videos added to my collection
3. PouchDB Backup and Restore
4. Improved YouTube playback performance
5. Typescript conversion
